Python Multi-Storage File Management API

This project provides a Python API for downloading a specific Google Drive file and storing it in different storage systems. The supported storage options include:

Local filesystem storage

AWS DynamoDB

Non-relational database (MongoDB)

The code uses an object-oriented approach, following the strategy pattern, with a unified interface for all storage systems.

Features

Download Google Drive Files:

Supports downloading public files from Google Drive.

Multiple Storage Systems:

Save files to the local filesystem.

Save files to AWS DynamoDB.

Save files to a MongoDB collection.

Extensible Architecture:

Easily add new storage systems by implementing the StorageSystem interface.

Requirements

Python Version

Python 3.7 or higher

Dependencies

Install the required libraries:

pip install boto3 pymongo requests

Setup and Configuration

1. AWS DynamoDB

Create a DynamoDB table in your AWS account:

Table name: DriveFiles

Primary key: file_id (String)

Configure your AWS credentials locally using the AWS CLI:

aws configure

Provide your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and the appropriate region.

Ensure the table exists in the specified region.

2. MongoDB

Set up a MongoDB instance:

Use a local MongoDB server or a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas.

Create a database called FileStorage and a collection called DriveFiles.

Update the MongoDB connection URI in the script.

3. Local Storage

Files will be saved in a directory called downloaded_files by default.

The directory is automatically created if it doesnâ€™t exist.

Usage

Step 1: Download File from Google Drive

Replace <YOUR_FILE_ID> in the script with the Google Drive file ID of the file you want to download.

Step 2: Run the Script

Run the script to test saving the downloaded file in all storage systems:

python script_name.py

Step 3: Check Storage Systems

Local Storage: Verify that the file is saved in the downloaded_files directory.

DynamoDB: Check the DriveFiles table in your AWS Management Console.

MongoDB: Query the DriveFiles collection to verify the file metadata and content.

Code Structure

Abstract Storage Class

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class StorageSystem(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def save_file(self, file_id, file_name, content):
        pass

This abstract class enforces a unified interface for all storage implementations.

Local Storage

class LocalStorage(StorageSystem):
    def save_file(self, file_id, file_name, content):
        ...

Stores files in the local filesystem.

DynamoDB Storage

class DynamoDBStorage(StorageSystem):
    def save_file(self, file_id, file_name, content):
        ...

Stores file metadata and content in AWS DynamoDB.

MongoDB Storage

class NonRelationalDBStorage(StorageSystem):
    def save_file(self, file_id, file_name, content):
        ...

Stores file metadata and content in MongoDB.

Example Output

Successful File Download and Storage:

File downloaded successfully: example_file.txt
Testing storage: LocalStorage
File saved locally at: downloaded_files/example_file.txt
Testing storage: DynamoDBStorage
File metadata and content stored in DynamoDB for file: example_file.txt
Testing storage: NonRelationalDBStorage
File metadata and content stored in MongoDB for file: example_file.txt

Extending the API

To add a new storage system:

Create a new class inheriting from StorageSystem.

Implement the save_file method.

Add an instance of the new storage system to the storage_systems list in the main function.

Example:

class NewStorageSystem(StorageSystem):
    def save_file(self, file_id, file_name, content):
        # Custom logic to save file
        pass

Troubleshooting

DynamoDB Connection Issues:

Ensure AWS credentials are correctly configured.

Verify the table name and region.

MongoDB Connection Issues:

Confirm the MongoDB server is running.

Check the URI, database name, and collection name.

Google Drive File Download Errors:

Ensure the file ID is correct and the file is publicly accessible.
